<h3> Abstract </h3>

<h3> Plan of Action </h3>
  <p><b>Methods:</b> There are two methods primarily used when adopting a Distance-based model. They are,
  <ul>
    <li>Neighbor-Joining</li>
    <li>UPGMA</li> 
  </ul>
  
  The widely used Character-based methods are as follows.
  <ul>
    <li>Maximum Likelihood</li>
    <li>Maximum Parsimony</li> 
  </ul>
 I have chosen Neighbor-Joining and Maximum Likelihood methods as respective Phenetic and Cladistic methods for evaluation and comparison.</p>
<p><b>Sequence</b> Phylogenetic trees can be constructued after processing either Protein or DNA sequences. I am going to use Protein sequences as my input.</p>
<p><b>Datasets</b> Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB) will serve as my source for the input datasets.</p>
<p><b>Tools:</b> I have identified PHYLIP 3.5 package as the primary tool to construct phylogenetic trees. It provides a wide-range of programs (PROTPARS, PROTDIST) to analyse sequence and generate distance matrix data as well as molecular sequence data. Tree constructing programs are too available in PHYLIP program library. T-Coffee can be used as the multpiple - sequence alignment tool</p>
